## Version 0.4.1 (2021-02-24)

### Enhancements

- Improve `TimerStatistics`. ([#55])
- Update JUnit to 4.13.2. ([#55])

### Optimizations

- Improve the buffer replacement strategy. ([#55])
	- Add a reference bit to every buffer so that the clock replacement strategy provides more stable performance.
- Remove the cached string from `BlockId`. ([#55])
	- Since `toString` of `BlockId` is rarely called, pre-computing the string not only does not help but also wastes resources.

### Code Refactor

- Refactor duplicated code in `LockTable`. ([#50])

### Bug Fixes

- Correct the author name in the `pom.xml`. ([#48])
- Resolve #49: bad verification while using aggregation fields after an order by clause. ([#54])
- Improve `IndexUpdatePlannerTest`. ([#55])
	- The name of the indices in the test case might be accidently treated as removable temp files.
- Remove an unstable test case. ([#55])
